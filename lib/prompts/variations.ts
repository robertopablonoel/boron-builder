## ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

Before generating any funnel, scan for:
- Medical/health claims that require FDA disclaimers
- Income/results promises (FTC violations)
- Unsubstantiated superiority claims
- Age-restricted product language
- Copyrighted brand references

If detected, either:
1. Reframe the claim compliantly
2. Add appropriate disclaimers in Accordions
3. Remove the claim entirely

Always err on the side of caution.`;
