### Pages & Components

## Features Implemented

### 1. Store Creation

- Creator automatically becomes owner
- Owner role automatically added to store_members table
- Redirects to store page after creation

### 2. Store List
- Shows all stores user belongs to
- Displays role badge (owner/admin/member)
- Shows creation date
- Empty state for new users
- Grid layout with hover effects

### 3. Store Dashboard
- Two tabs: Members and Pending Invites
- Member list showing:
  - Avatar (first letter of email)
  - Name and email
  - Role
  - Remove button (admin/owner only)
- Pending invites list showing:
  - Email
  - Role
  - Invitation date
  - Cancel button (admin/owner only)

### 4. Member Invitation
- Admin and owner can invite members
- Choose role: admin or member
- Email validation
- Generates unique token
- 7-day expiration
- Copy invite link to clipboard
- Success confirmation

### 5. Invitation Acceptance

  - Store name
  - Inviter information
  - Role being granted
  - Expiration date
- Accept/decline buttons
- Email matching validation
- Adds user to store_members on accept
- Redirects to store dashboard

### 6. Role-Based Permissions

**Owner:**
- Create store (becomes owner)
- Invite members
- Change member roles
- Remove members
- Delete store
- Update store settings

**Admin:**
- Invite members
- Remove non-admin members
- Update store settings

**Member:**
- View store
- View members
- Create content (future: funnels)

### 7. Security Features
- RLS policies enforce store membership
- Token-based invitations with expiration
- Email validation on accept
- Permission checks on all actions
- Cannot remove owner
- Admins cannot remove other admins

## Database Integration

Uses existing tables:
- `stores` - Store records
- `store_members` - User-store relationships with roles
- `store_invites` - Pending invitations

All tables have proper RLS policies enforcing:
- Users can only see stores they're members of
- Only admins/owners can invite
- Only owners can delete stores
- Store data is isolated by membership

## Files Created
