# Task 03: Auth Pages Complete ✅

Simple email/password authentication is now implemented and ready to use!

## What Was Built

### 1. Sign Up Page (`/auth/signup`)
- Email + password + full name
- Automatic profile creation
- No email verification (local dev)
- Redirects to dashboard on success

### 2. Sign In Page (`/auth/signin`)
- Email + password
- Remembers redirect location
- Error handling
- Links to sign up

### 3. Callback Handler (`/auth/callback`)
- Handles OAuth redirects (for future Google OAuth)
- Exchanges code for session
- Redirects to dashboard

### 4. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- Protected route (requires auth)
- Shows user profile info
- Server-side rendered
- Next steps outlined

## Configuration

**Local Development (Current)**:
- Email confirmation: **DISABLED** ✓
- Sign up → instant access (no email verification)
- Perfect for local testing

**Production (Future)**:
- Can enable email confirmation
- Add Google OAuth
- Add password reset flow

## Testing the Auth Flow

### 1. Sign Up
```bash
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. Enter: name, email, password
3. Click "Sign up"
4. → Redirected to /dashboard ✓
```

### 2. Sign In
```bash
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
2. Enter: email, password
3. Click "Sign in"
4. → Redirected to /dashboard ✓
```

### 3. Protected Routes
```bash
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard (while signed out)
2. → Redirected to /auth/signin?redirectTo=/dashboard
3. Sign in
4. → Redirected back to /dashboard ✓
```

### 4. View Auth Status
```bash
Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/test
Shows: user info, session status, etc.
```

## File Structure

```
app/
├── auth/
│   ├── callback/
│   │   └── route.ts              # OAuth callback handler
│   ├── signin/
│   │   └── page.tsx              # Sign in form
│   ├── signup/
│   │   └── page.tsx              # Sign up form
│   └── test/
│       └── page.tsx              # Auth test page
└── dashboard/
    └── page.tsx                  # Protected dashboard
```

## How It Works

### Sign Up Flow
1. User enters email/password on `/auth/signup`
2. Supabase creates user in `auth.users`
3. Trigger auto-creates profile in `profiles` table
4. User immediately signed in (no email verification)
5. Redirect to `/dashboard`

### Sign In Flow
1. User enters credentials on `/auth/signin`
2. Supabase validates password
3. Session created (stored in cookies)
4. Redirect to dashboard (or original destination)

### Protection Flow
1. User tries to access `/dashboard`
2. Middleware checks for session cookie
3. If no session → redirect to `/auth/signin?redirectTo=/dashboard`
4. After sign in → redirect back to `/dashboard`

## Code Examples

### Sign Up a Test User

```typescript
// Visit /auth/signup and enter:
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123
Full Name: Test User

// Instantly signed in, no email verification!
```

### Access User in Server Component

```typescript
// app/dashboard/page.tsx
import { requireAuth, getUserProfile } from '@/lib/auth'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const user = await requireAuth() // Redirects if not authenticated
  const profile = await getUserProfile(user.id)

  return <div>Welcome, {profile.full_name}!</div>
}
```

### Access User in Client Component

```typescript
// Any client component
'use client'
import { useAuth } from '@/components/providers/auth-provider'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (!user) return <div>Please sign in</div>

  return <div>Welcome, {user.email}!</div>
}
```

## Database

When a user signs up:

1. **auth.users** - User created by Supabase
2. **profiles** - Auto-created by `handle_new_user()` trigger
3. Ready to use immediately!

## Next Steps

### Task 04: Store Management
Now that users can sign in, we need to:
1. Create a store (organization) on first sign in
2. Allow users to create additional stores
3. Invite team members to stores
4. Switch between stores

### Task 05: Funnel Management
After stores are set up:
1. Create funnels linked to stores
2. Edit/delete funnels
3. Publish funnels
4. View funnel list

## Future Enhancements

### Google OAuth (Production)
Add to `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const handleGoogleSignIn = async () => {
  const supabase = createClient()
  await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'google',
    options: {
      redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`,
    },
  })
}
```

Then add Google button to UI.

### Email Verification (Production)
Update `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[auth.email]
enable_confirmations = true
```

### Password Reset
Add forgot password flow:
1. `/auth/forgot-password` page
2. Call `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`
3. User gets email with reset link
4. `/auth/reset-password` page

## Security Features

- ✅ Passwords hashed by Supabase
- ✅ JWT-based sessions
- ✅ Secure cookies (httpOnly)
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Rate limiting (built into Supabase)
- ✅ Row Level Security on all tables

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Sign Up
- Make sure Supabase is running: `supabase start`
- Check `.env.local` has correct URL/keys
- Check browser console for errors

### Redirects Not Working
- Check `middleware.ts` is in project root
- Verify protected routes are configured
- Check browser cookies are enabled

### Profile Not Created
- Check `handle_new_user()` trigger exists
- Run: `npx tsx scripts/verify-schema.ts`
- Check Supabase logs in dashboard

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Users can sign up with email/password
- ✅ Users can sign in
- ✅ Protected routes redirect to sign in
- ✅ After sign in, redirected back to original destination
- ✅ Dashboard shows user info
- ✅ Profile auto-created in database
- ✅ Sessions persist across page reloads

**Status**: ✅ Auth pages complete! Ready for Task 04 (Store Management)
