# Task 05: Funnel Management

**Status:** ðŸ”² Not Started
**Dependencies:** Task 04 (Store Management)
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

## Overview
Implement full CRUD operations for funnels within store context, allowing users to create, save, edit, and manage their AI-generated funnels.

## Goals

- [ ] Add funnel editing capability
- [ ] Build funnel status management (draft/published)
- [ ] Create funnel detail page
- [ ] Add duplicate and delete actions

## Database Table (Already Created)
- `funnels` - Stores funnel data with store association

## Implementation

- "Create New Funnel" button
- Empty state for no funnels

### 2. Funnel Card Component
